# Attendance-Marking

My project is a facial recognition-based attendance marking system. <br>
It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces in images captured by a camera.<br>
By comparing the detected faces with a database of known faces, the system can identify individuals and mark their attendance automatically.<br>
The project aims to streamline the attendance tracking process in various settings such as classrooms, workplaces, or events, eliminating the need for manual attendance management.<br>
This automated system enhances efficiency, accuracy, and convenience for both administrators and attendees.<br>
